# NoSleep
A simple software solution to keep your laptop awake


Often we don't want to let the computers sleep.

Special thanks to LLM Claude 3.5 sonnet(https://lmarena.ai/) and a marvelous compiled language [Vlang](https://vlang.io/)



Steps:-
  - If you don't trust then go to https://vlang.io and download the compiler and compile on own, hardly take 5 minutes from downloading to compiling
  - Or simply run the "NoSleep.exe", no admin required
  - To kill the program use stop.bat or it automatically kills on shutdown
  - You can ask https://copilot.microsoft.com/ ,"How to make a program start on windows startup".
